<div class="col-8" style="background-color:white" border: 30px solid;"><p>Koalas are one of the most iconic animals of Australia. These cuddly marsupials are known for their distinctive appearance, with their fluffy ears, round faces, and furry bodies. However, despite their cute and friendly appearance, koalas are also fascinating creatures that have a unique place in the ecosystem.
Koalas are native to Australia and are found in a variety of habitats, from coastal forests to inland woodlands. They are arboreal animals, which means that they spend most of their time living in trees. Koalas are primarily herbivores and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals. Their specialized digestive system allows them to break down the toxic compounds in eucalyptus leaves and extract the nutrients they need.
One of the most interesting facts about koalas is that they have a very low metabolic rate. This means that they need very little food to survive, and they spend most of their time sleeping or resting in trees.
</p>

<p>In fact, adult koalas can sleep for up to 20 hours a day! This low energy lifestyle is an adaptation to their diet of nutrient-poor eucalyptus leaves, which require a lot of energy to digest.
Koalas are also unique in their social behavior. They are generally solitary animals, with males and females only coming together during mating season. However, they do have a complex social hierarchy, with dominant males occupying the best territories and mating with multiple females. Female koalas are also very protective of their young and will carry their joeys in their pouches for up to six months.
Despite their popularity, koalas are facing many threats in the wild.

 Habitat loss, disease, and climate change are all putting pressure on koala populations, and many areas of Australia have seen significant declines in koala numbers in recent years. Conservation efforts are underway to protect koalas and their habitats, including measures such as habitat restoration, disease management, and the creation of wildlife corridors to connect fragmented habitats.
In conclusion, koalas are a unique and fascinating animal that play an important role in the ecosystem of Australia.

 Their specialized diet, low energy lifestyle, and social behavior make them a truly remarkable species. However, they are also facing significant threats to their survival, and it is important that we take action to protect these iconic creatures for future generations to enjoy.
