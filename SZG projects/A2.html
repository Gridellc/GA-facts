<div class="col-8" style="background-color:white" border: 30px solid;"><p>Whales roam throughout all of the world's oceans, communicating with complex and mysterious sounds. Their sheer size amazes us: the blue whale can reach lengths of more than 100 feet and weigh up to 200 tonsâ€”as much as 33 elephants!

Despite living in the water, whales breathe air. And like humans, they are warm-blooded mammals who nurse their young. A thick layer of fat called blubber insulates them from cold ocean waters.

Some whales (such as blue whales, right, bow head, sei and gray whales) are known as baleen whales. This refers to the fact that they have special bristle-like structures in their mouths (called baleen) that strain food from the water. Other whales, such as beluga or sperm whales, have teeth.

Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. Whales play a significant role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere; each great whale sequesters an approximate 33 tons of CO2 on average, thus playing their part in the fight against climate change.

Unfortunately, whales have faced many threats from human activities. The hunting of whales for their meat, oil, and other products has led to significant declines in whale populations around the world. In addition, pollution, habitat loss, and climate change are all putting pressure on whale populations and their ecosystems.
In recent years, there have been many efforts to protect and conserve whales. The International Whaling Commission was established in 1946 to regulate the hunting of whales, and many countries have implemented laws and regulations to protect whale populations and their habitats. In addition, research into whale behavior and ecology has helped us to better understand these amazing creatures and the role they play in the ocean ecosystem.
In conclusion, whales are some of the most remarkable animals on the planet. Their size, intelligence, and social behavior make them a fascinating species to study and admire. However, whales also face many threats from human activities, and it is important that we take action to protect these incredible creatures and the ecosystems they inhabit. By working together to conserve whales and their habitats, we can help ensure that these magnificent animals continue to thrive for generations to come.
